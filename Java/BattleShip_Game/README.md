# BattleShipGame

Right now the game is only in 1 Dimension.

##### Motive:

There is a hidden board that contains some number of ships. The ships are of different sizes present at random locations on the board. 

Your motive is to destroy all the ships in minimum number of hits.

##### How To play

Guess the position of ships by entering a number between 0 to (boardSize - 1).

The computer will tell you if you hit or miss the ship.

On sinking a complete ship, the computer will tell you that you sunk the complete ship and it will also tell you its size.
