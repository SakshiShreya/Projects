# Circle Packing

A circle packing is an arrangement of circles inside a given boundary such that no two overlap and some (or all) of them are mutually tangent. The generalization to spheres is called a sphere packing. Tessellations of regular polygons correspond to particular circle packings.

In this code, we give an image to the code as input. The image should have a black background and any other lighter shade (preferably) as the foreground. The code will perform Circle Packing in an animation for the foreground objects.

The code runs on python 2.

Following libraries need to be installed before running the code:
1. openCV (2.9.4 or above)
2. numpy
