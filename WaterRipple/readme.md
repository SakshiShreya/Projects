This code is an animation of water ripples taken from [# https://web.archive.org/web/20160418004149/http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/graphics/x_water.htm
]
I have tried to optimize it in python. I have also added mouse interactions to the code.

Code works on both python 2 and 3.

Following libraries need to be installed for running the code:
1. openCV (2 or 3)
2. numpy
3. scipy
